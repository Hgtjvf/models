Baseline Risk Model – File Description

Project Overview:
This folder contains all scripts, datasets, and models related to the Baseline Risk Model for the Smart Patient Risk Band project. The model predicts patient risk levels using Random Forest and provides risk metrics for monitoring.

Files and Their Purpose

Datasets
baseline_risk_dataset.csv
Primary training dataset for the Random Forest model. Contains derived physiological metrics and the target column risk_level.
baseline_risk_test_dataset.csv
Test dataset used to evaluate model performance. Includes the same features as the training dataset.


Scripts

generate_dataset.py
Generates the training dataset (baseline_risk_dataset.csv) with simulated or collected patient metrics.

generate_test_dataset.py
Generates a test dataset (baseline_risk_test_dataset.csv) for evaluating the model.

train_model.py
Trains the Random Forest model using the training dataset and saves the model as a .joblib file.
Output: baseline_risk_rf_model.joblib

run_model.py
Loads the trained Random Forest model and predicts risk for a single patient input.
Outputs:

risk_level (0 = Low, 1 = Moderate, 2 = High)

risk_probability

confidence_score

top_contributing_features

test_model.py
Evaluates the trained model on the test dataset and generates a reports.txt file containing:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

False alerts / misclassifications

Confusion matrix

Saved Models

baseline_risk_rf_model.joblib
Random Forest model trained on baseline_risk_dataset.csv. Used for prediction.

baseline_risk_model_columns.joblib
Stores the column structure used during training to ensure proper feature alignment during prediction.

Reports

reports.txt
Output file generated by test_model.py containing evaluation metrics and model performance summary.
