1️⃣ Individual variability in vitals

Each patient’s normal vital ranges are different.

Example:

Patient A: HR normally 60–80 bpm

Patient B: HR normally 90–110 bpm

A single model would treat Patient B’s normal 95 bpm as anomalous if it’s trained on Patient A’s data.

Patient-specific models learn the “normal pattern” for that particular person, so anomalies are truly unusual for them, not just unusual for the population.

2️⃣ Personalized anomaly detection

Health signals like HR, HRV, SpO₂, Temperature, Activity, FallEvent are highly individualized.

Isolation Forest works best when trained on the actual distribution of “normal” data.

By training one model per patient, the system can detect subtle deviations that might indicate early risk.

3️⃣ Better detection accuracy

A global model would be too general:

High false positives for patients whose vitals are naturally outside the average.

High false negatives for patients whose anomalies are within population norms.

Patient-specific models reduce both false positives and false negatives.

4️⃣ Privacy & modularity

Each model can be stored and updated independently per patient.

Allows for:

Adding new patients without retraining everyone else

Retraining individual models as more patient data is collected

Easier debugging if a model is underperforming

5️⃣ Computational efficiency for streaming data

For real-time monitoring:

Only the relevant patient’s model is loaded for prediction

Reduces memory and CPU usage compared to a single huge global model

In short:

Each patient is unique, and vital signs are personal. Multiple models ensure personalized, accurate, and sensitive anomaly detection, which is essential for early health risk alerts.









Here’s a concise, viva-friendly version:

> Each patient’s vital signs have unique normal ranges.
> A single model would misclassify normal variations as anomalies.
> Patient-specific models detect true abnormalities accurately and individually.

This is short, clear, and easy to explain in 2–3 lines.
